# ClassSchedulerMVC-Design

Class scheduling project that was made in MVC architectural design.

In order for the project to work properly the user will have to generate 2 text files by running StudentClass.java which acts as our "database".

From there the user can run Main.java and will be able to log in or create an account if they do not already have one.
